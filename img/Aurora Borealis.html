      Aurora Borealis
    </h1>
    <p>Aurora polar (o aurora polaris) es un fenómeno en forma de brillo o luminiscencia que se presenta en el cielo nocturno, generalmente en zonas polares, aunque puede aparecer en otras zonas del mundo durante breves períodos. En el hemisferio sur es conocida como aurora austral y en el hemisferio norte como aurora boreal (de Aurora, la diosa romana del amanecer, la palabra latina Auster, que significa sur, y la palabra griega Bóreas, que significa norte).</p>

    <p>The northern lights are a type of ray of the sun that falls to earth and is trapped in the atsmosphere, its name comes from "aurora" the goddess of dawn, that the mythology roamana flies through the firmament to announce the arrival of the sun but that's it is only a theory, it is a phenomenon why we see barias lights in the night sky, normally they are green in color but may have reddish or asulated tones and also may produce sounds at long distances.</p>

    <p>They are also a type of particles probenting from the sun, those particles are attracted by the magnetic poles of the planet earth in the same way as a magnet, finally they end up being captured by the magnetic field of the earth and directed to the extreme northern osteea and the south pole, in a way that those particles that were probening from the sun simply penetrate through the poles, are called boral auroras in the north pole and southern auroras in the south pole, each country or imperica has its own theory that they are for example : the eskimals believed that they were spirits that played in the sky and that's why nuca let their children go out at night because they were afraid that they would be taken away, the vikings believed that they were about the valquirias, goddess norwaries of the mythology daughters of odin.</p>
